###### **The Database** - A framework for making an encycolpedia-like Database by extracting information from (syntaxed) posts and notes, interpreting them as objects linked together.


#### *Outline*

The web has too much information, and doing online research you only get the views of a few people. 

'The Database' would store how things are described at a low level.
The representation would not be comparable to the comprehensability of wikipedia at first.
But using the low level information intelligently, e.g. automatically extracting from multiple articles in a subject, has potential to be simple, versatile and comprenehsive. - And starting it would become a long term AI project.

One could use the information to visualise contradicting views on different subjects, how many support them, together with the users credibilities.

The information could be extracted from posts following a specific syntax.
A simple starting solution would be to build on top of open Evernote Notebooks, where researchers could write their findings, and everything would get automatically indexed together with its the author's name.

Mapping up all this knowledge and all the connections has many possibilities, might be beautiful, but most of all useful.

Later development could implement machine understanding of anything from blog posts, scientific articles, to direct input from large populations doing measurements on the effect of e.g. different foods on wellbeing.

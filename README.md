### A Git for brainstorming:


###### **The Database** - A dumb AI making an encycolpedia-like Database by extracting information from (syntaxed?) posts, interpreting them as objects linked together.


#### *Pitch*

The web has too much information, and doing online research you only get the views of a few people. 

'The Database' would store how things are described online at a low level. 
This would not be comparable to the comprehensability of wikipedia at first.
But using this information intelligently, e.g. automatically composing articles in a subjects, has potential to be extremely simple, versatile and comprenehsive. - It would start a long term AI project.

One could visualise the contradicting views on different subjects, how many support them (kind of statistical significance), together with the users credibilities.

The information could be extracted from posts following a specific syntax.
A simple solution is making it for open Evernote Notebooks, where researchers could write their findings, and everything would get automatically indexed together with its source.

Mapping up all this knowledge and all the connections has many possibilities, might be beautiful, but most of all useful.

Later development could implement machine understanding of anything from blog posts, scientific articles, to say direct input from large online population doing measurements on the effect of different foods on wellbeing.



#### *Let's do this*
Do you have ideas already? Got knowledge on similar projects? Write. In this git. Organization is not decided yet.

This can be started in many ways. The one with most small wins, that could be picked up is
an implementation for scientists to more easily move into [Open Science](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_2.0"Open Science"). Everyone is using evernote, but not blogs. A bridge for evernote accounts
to easily share posts they want. Adding useful utilities like suggesting links to others based on what you have in your
(both public or private). And moving on to trying AIs datamining the information.

Most importantly is that it should be very openâ€š and possible for everyone to use well sorted information in their AIs or visualisations.
And add sorted information from new sources across the web or from real life.
Start with a good API and make future happend.

###### **The Database** - A system making an encycolpedia-like Database by extracting information from (syntaxed) posts and notes, interpreting them as objects linked together.


#### *Outline*

The web has too much information, and doing online research you only get the views of a few people. 

'The Database' would store how things are described online at a low level. 
This would not be comparable to the comprehensability of wikipedia at first.
But using this information intelligently, e.g. automatically composing articles in a subjects, has potential to be extremely simple, versatile and comprenehsive. - It would start a long term AI project.

One could visualise the contradicting views on different subjects, how many support them (kind of statistical significance), together with the users credibilities.

The information could be extracted from posts following a specific syntax.
A simple solution is making it for open Evernote Notebooks, where researchers could write their findings, and everything would get automatically indexed together with its source.

Mapping up all this knowledge and all the connections has many possibilities, might be beautiful, but most of all useful.

Later development could implement machine understanding of anything from blog posts, scientific articles, to say direct input from large online population doing measurements on the effect of different foods on wellbeing.
